## Caffeinating

When you find something helpful in here, you could buy me a coffee. I spend a lot of time and effort on curating this list. Keeping me properly caffeinated accelerates things. And it would really make my day. Kindness of strangers and all that. If you can't or won't, no hard feelings. It's available completely free for a reason. Still, it would be awesome.
